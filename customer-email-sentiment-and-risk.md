```
It takes a batch of customer emails and breaks each one down into:
	1.	Sentiment check — positive, negative, or neutral.
	2.	Risk flag - whether it mentions legal trouble.
	3.	Concise summary — the customer’s main ask or complaint in ≤15 words.
	4.	Structured output — everything captured in clean JSON, one object per email.

It also forces handling of messy cases: mixed emotions, legal threats, or vague emails with no clear request.

  2. "Your product failed catastrophically. This is unacceptable. I may have to tell my mom about this. I can't believe the product was so bad! I am glad I was born from a woman who has passed the bar. Your company has really lowered the bar on quality!"

  3. "I'm generally satisfied, but your recent update removed a feature I use daily. Please advise."

  4. "Is there any update on my shipment? It's been over three weeks with no communication. Extremely frustrated."
